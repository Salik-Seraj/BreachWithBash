# # Integers, strings or characters? How to create different variable data types in bash shell?
# # Letâ€™s mess around a little bit more with the variables.

# # You can use the equal sign to create and set the value of a variable. For example, the following line will create a variable named age and will set its value to 27.

age=20

# # You can use the echo command to print the value of a variable. For example, the following line will print the value of the age variable.
echo "My age is $age years old."
# # You can also use the double quotes to print a variable value. For example, the following line will print the value of the age variable.
echo "My age is ${age} years old."

# Bash shell supports different data types for variables. Here are some of the most common variable data types:

# Integer: A variable that holds an integer value. For example, the following line will create a variable named my_integer and will set its value to 10.
my_integer=10

# String: A variable that holds a string value. For example, the following line will create a variable named my_string and will set its value to "Hello, World!".

my_string="Hello, World!"

# Character: A variable that holds a single character value. For example, the following line will create a variable named my_character and will set its value to the letter 'a'.

my_character='a'


# # Let's try some operations with these variables.

# Addition: You can add two integer variables together using the plus sign (+). For example, the following line will print the sum of the age variable and the my_integer variable.


echo "The sum of my age and my_integer is $((age + my_integer))."

# Constant variables in bash shell
# You can also create a constant variable, that is to say, a variable whose value will never change! This can be done by preceding your variable name with the readonly command:

readonly PI=3.14159

# Trying to change the value of a constant variable will result in an error.
# PI=3.1415926

# Before you go, try turning Hello World script to a smart HelloWorld script
# Now since you just learned how to do command substitution, it would make sense to visit the Hello World script one last time to perfect it!

# Last time, you asked the user to enter his/her name so the script greets them; this time, you are not going to ask, your script already knows it!

# Use the whoami command along with command substitution to greet whoever run the script:

echo "Hello, $(whoami)!"

# Now, let's create a simple calculator script.

# Write a script that takes two numbers as command line arguments and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them.

# The script should check if the correct number of arguments are provided and if they are numbers. If not, it should display an error message and exit.

# For example, if you run the script like this:


# ./calculator.sh 5 3

# It should output:

# 5 + 3 = 8
# 5 - 3 = 2
# 5 * 3 = 15
# 5 / 3 = 1.66666666667

# Remember to handle division by zero errors and display an appropriate error message.

# Lastly, let's create a simple script that prints the current date and time in a specific format.

# Write a script that displays the current date and time in the format:

# Monday, January 01, 2022 12:34:56 PM

# You can use the date command along with some formatting options to achieve this.

# For example, if you run the script like this:


# ./current_date_time.sh

# It should output:

# Monday, January 01, 2022 12:34:56 PM
